#### Bells for Biodiversity
I started this project with the ambition of reducing the number of reptiles, birds, and small mammals predated by domestic cats. It is an iniative aimed at raising awareness of the detrimental effects of domestic cats on urban wildlife and subsequently providing cat owners with tools to reduce their cats impact. There is an instagram campaign (#bellsforbiodiversity) and some blog posts available to help spread our message. For more information, please check out our [website](http://www.bellsforbiodiversity.wordpress.com/).


#### Rottnest Island
I consider myself a life-time lover of Rotto, and I took part in the Green Army Rottnest Island project targeting conservation efforts on Samphire Communities in 2016. I performed tasks including native seed collection, propagation and processing, fencing and tree guarding, re-vegetation, and general nursery work. I now regularly return as a volunteer in the nursery, assisting the Environmental Office team on the island with vegetation and water quality surveys, quokka counting, tree-planting and reptile surveys (working closely with DBCA).


#### Madagascar Conservation and Research Institute (MRCI)
I spent a number of months in 2015 at MRCI volunteering for a project which investigated the influence of tourism on the cooperative behaviours of black lemurs on Nosy Be, an island off the north coast of Madagascar. I also helped develop a community outreach program where we educated the island's local village about how to best preserve their wildlife, and the benefits of sustainable tourism. 

#### Modgaji Conservation Project and Cheetah Conservation Project (CCF) Australia.
In 2015 I travelled to Modgaji Conservation Project in South Africa to volunteer. I was asked to stay on as a voluntary member of staff carrying out tasks such as hand raising cheetah cubs and serval kittens, and assisting with feeding plans, enrichment, and general husbandry of a variety of predators including caracals and hyenas. Additionally, I assisted in coordinating international volunteers and leading conservation-based activities. When I returned to Australia, I worked closely with CCF to help raise funds and awareness for cheetah conservation by hosting a series of talks and events across Perth.


#### Educational Work 
Beginning in 2012 as a teaching assistant at The Cavendish School (London), I developed a passion for education. This lead me to spend the proceeding years volunteering in various forms of educational systems - Sudanese-Australian Integrated Learning, Australia (2013); English Teacher for ILCS Women’s Centre, Morocco (2014); English Teacher for Serapio Baqueiro Preve Primary School, Mexico (2014); and Kitendo Children’s Charity, Kenya (2014 & 2015). I love working with kids, and spent many years employed part time at Mulberry Tree after school-hours care during my undegrad. 


#### Nakavango Conservation Reserve
In 2015, I volunteered at Nakavango Conservation Reserve Zimbabwe, one of the last strong-holds for Black Rhinos in Southern Africa. My work included tracking animals, removal of alien species, and general reserve management and maintenance.
