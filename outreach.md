* #### Rottnest Island
As I consider myself a life-time lover of Rotto, I took part in the Green Army Rottnest Island project targeting conservation efforts on Samphire Communities. I performed tasks including native seed collection, propagation and processing, fencing and tree guarding, re-vegetation, and general nursery work. I now regularly return as a volunteer in the nursery, assisting the Environmental Office team on the island with vegetation and water quality surveys, quokka counting, tree-planting and reptile surveys (working closely with DBCA).

* #### Modgaji Conservation Project and Cheetah Conservation Project (CCF) Australia.
In 2015 I travelled to Modgaji Conservation Project in South Africa to volunteer. I was asked to stay on as a voluntary member of staff carrying out tasks such as hand raising cheetah cubs and serval kittens, assisting with feeding plans, enrichment, and general husbandry of a variety of predators including caracals and hyenas. Additionally, I assisted in coordinating international volunteers and leading conservation-based activities. When I returned to Australia, I worked closely with CCF to help raise funds  and awareness for cheetah conservation.


* #### Madagascare Conservation and Research Institute (MRCI)
I spent a number of months in 2015 at MRCI volunteering for a project which investigated the influence of tourism on the cooperative behaviours of black lemurs on Nosy Be, an island of the north coast of Madagascar. I also helped develop a community outreach program where we educated the local people about how to care for their wildlife, and incorporate it into tourism sustainably. 


* #### Educational Work 
Beginning in 2012 as a teaching assistant at The Cavendish School (London), I developed a passion for education. This lead me to spend the proceeding years volunteering in various forms of educational systems - Sudanese-Australian Integrated Learning, Australia (2013); English Teacher for ILCS Women’s Centre, Morocco (2014); English Teacher for Serapio Baqueiro Preve Primary School, Mexico (2014); and Kitendo Children’s Charity, Kenya (2014 & 2015). I love working with kids, and spent many years working part time at Mulberry Tree after school-hours care during my undegrad. 


* #### Nakavango Conservation Reserve
In 2015, I volunteered at Nakavango Conservation Reserve Zimbabwe, one of the last strong-holds for Black Rhino's in Southern Africa. My work included tracking animals, removal of alien species, and general reserve management and maintenance.
