<i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i> My primary interests surround the combination of population and behavioural ecology. By integrating individual, social, and environmental factors, I seek to determine proximate causes of behavioural responses, and to identify their influence on population-level demographic processes. My multidisciplinary approach and unique skill set have lead to a variety of fruitful international collaborations. I have a strong analytical and field-based background, and now aim to extend further into research - specifically beginning to explore and answer my own questions, and work towards the conservation of Australia's unique biodiversity. 


<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> I completed my Bachelor of Science, majoring in Zoology and Conservation Biology at the University of Western Australia, including a semester abroad at Boston College, USA. After gaining some field experience, I then completed a Masters in Quantitative Environmental Sciences at the University of Zurich in Switzerland. I worked with Prof. Arpat Ozgul and Dr. Gabriele Cozzi in the [PopEcol](http://www.popecol.org/) population ecology lab. I am now completing my PhD back at UWA, under the supervision of Dr. Nicki Mitchell, Assoc. Prof. Ben Phillips, and Dr Adrian Wayne.


<i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> I have an underlying passion for field work, and happily take any opportunity to get back out there! I possess a wide range of field skills, from capturing animals and recording behavioural observations to radio telometry, ultrasounding and accelerometer collar deployment.


<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> I conduct the majority of my analyses in R, using techniques such as generalized mixed effects modelling, Cox's proportional hazard modelling, and principal component analyses. I have recently been working on my population modelling skills, using a Bayesian framework to build N-mixture, CJS and multistate population models. I am capable of programming using languages including MySQL, R, Markdown, Latex, JAGS, and Python.

<i class="fas fa-hiking"></i> My hobbies include drinking tea, being outdoors (hiking, camping and snorkelling), gardening, playing board games, and the occassional skeleton articulation. I also have a passion for travelling abroad and exploring new cultures, especially where there's exotic wildlife!
