### Projects

#### Same data, different analysts
Like me, have you ever wondered what effect individual decisions can have on statistical analyses? During lockdown in 2020, I took part in a large collaborative study investigating the influence of individual analysts' decisions on effect sizes in ecology and evolution. Each collaborator answered the same pre-determined question with the same data-set and the paper will evaluate the extent to which effect sizes differ between analysts. The study has been provisionally accepted to *BMC Biology* so keep an eye out!

#### Kalahari meerkat project
Between 2017 and 2019 I was a research assistant for the Kalahari meerkat project, and an on-site manager for the meerkat dispersal project in South Africa. My work was field-based and involved radio tracking wild meerkat groups, building, testing and deploying GPS and accelerometer collars, and liasing with international collaborators. My enthusiasm and work ethic led to a variety of collaborations, and after my time in the Kalahari, I travelled to Zurich to complete my MSc using the meerkat data I helped to collect. My project focussed on dispersing female meerkats, and how their behaviour and physiology changes across the dispersal process. My thesis was titled *"Behavioural change during dispersal and its demographic consequences in a cooperative breeder"*, which I am currently preparing for publication. I was lucky enough to present my work through a [poster presentation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337950675_Foraging_and_vigilance_trade_offs_during_dispersal_and_their_fitness_consequences) at the *British Ecological Society* Annual meeting in Belfast, 2019, and during a short talk at Biology20, a conference in Fribourg, Switzerland.

#### IUCN Australian Squamate Assessment
In 2017, I was one of four students across Australia selected to take part in the *International Union for the Conservation of Nature* (IUCN) red list assessment for Australia's squamate species. I was required to perform extensive literature reviews and create individual profiles for over 200 species - which are now published on the IUCN Red List website (eg. [Frilled Lizard, *Chlamydosaurus kingii*](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/170384/21644690)). Following an intense workshop with Australia's reptile experts, the information was collated to determine national patterns of extinction risk.

### Quantitative and analytical skills
* **R**: Four years of experience using R in data visualization and statistical analyses, most prominently general and generalized linear mixed effects models, Cox proportional hazard models, principal component analysis, and extensive use of the *tidyverse*.
* **JAGS**: Fundamental understanding of JAGS language for use in Bayesian computing of N-Mixture, CJS and multi-state population modelling.
* **MySQL**: Extracting and manipulating data from large datasets, three years of experience.
* **Python**: Foundational understanding for data handling, analysis, and visualisation using *NumPy*, *pandas*, and *Matplotlib*.
* **GIS**: Basic experience extracting, creating and manipulating layers to visualize and analyse spatial/geographic data.
* **LaTeX**: Used regularly for formatting and presenting documents.

### Practical and field based skills
* **VHF radio tracking**: 2 years experience in tracking habituated, collared, Meerkats - with dispersing individuals ranging up to 15km. 
* **Capturing wild animals**: Experience trapping a variety of taxa, using specific trapping methods - including pitfall traps, mist nets, Elliot traps, Havahart cage-traps, and camera traps.
* **Deploying data-collection collars**: For use on Meerkats, I constructed, tested, attached, and exported data from GPS/accelerometer collars.
* **Ultrasounding**: Using a portable ultrasound machine, I scanned for pregnancies in Meerkats,
occasionally whilst individuals were under anaesthesia but predominantly whilst individuals were unanesthetized.
* **Collecting and processing samples**: Familiar with collecting DNA, faecal, and morphometric data from reptiles and small mammals. Additional extraction of hormones from faecal samples for fGCM analysis.
* **Behavioural and life history observations**: Primarily collection of adlib, focal follow, and group level scan data. In addition, regularly recording pregnancy, health and dominance hierarchies, and following their foraging success by regularly collecting body weight data. 
* **Driving**:  2 years experience operating 4x4 vehicles in loose sand, additionally I am capable of completing fundamental maintenance tasks. I hold a current Australian and International Drivers license.
